Hello, my name is Christian Kantelberg. I work as an IT security manager in a state institution and privately I deal with servers, linux, photography and everything else that interests me in the wide wide IT landscape.

## Contact
Feel free to contact me and talk about the written word that has been written down or shared here. You can contact me in the nostalgic way (you find my mail adress [here](/impressum)) or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/der__k).

## Colophon
This website runs with [Ghost](http://ghost.org) and the design is from [Oscar Morrison](http://oscarmorrison.com).

## My setup
Below you will find some information about my IT setup with which I am currently working. Share this information with others is currently *IN* :-D

### Hardware
I am working with a 13-inch MacBook Pro (Late 2015) with 8GB of random access memory and 128GB of memory. It is connected to a 24-inch Acer S242HLCBID display and extended by a apple keyboard (wired) and a Logitech Mouse G300. Now and then I also get my [Thinkpad T61](http://thinkwiki.de/T61) with 4GB memory and 256 SSD from the drawer.

Mobile I'm traveling with an [iPhone SE](https://www.apple.com/de/iphone-se/) and an iPad Air first generation.

As data storage I use an [RPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) configuration and a USB3 RAID system.

### Software
The MacBook Pro comes with macOS Sierra under the hood and the T61 runs with [Manjaro XFCE edition](https://manjaro.github.io/). The editor of my choice is [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) with [dark-material-theme](https://github.com/naderi/material-theme-for-brackets) and for markdown I use [write](http://writeapp.net/mac/). My data I move with [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) to the servers of [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) or a push with the [Github client](https://client.github.com) to [Github](https://github.com/). For graphics and photos, I use the grandiose [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop.html) or [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) from the [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/catalog.html). Notes and ideas are still flowing into [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) or [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/).
