Hello, my name is Christian Kantelberg. I work as an IT security manager in a state institution and privately I deal with servers, linux, photography and everything else that interests me in the wide wide IT landscape.

## Colophon
This website runs with [Jekyll](http://jykell.org) on [Github](https://github.com) and the design is from [Hanju Jamie J](https://github.com/AWEEKJ).

## My setup
Below you will find some information about my IT setup with which I am currently working. Share this information with others is currently *IN* :-D

### Hardware
I am working with a 13-inch MacBook Air (M1 2020) with 8GB of random access memory and 256GB of memory. It is connected to a 23-inch HP E23 G4 S242HLCBID display and extended by a Logitech MX keys keyboard and a Logitech Mouse MX Master. Now and then I also get my [Thinkpad T61](http://thinkwiki.de/T61) with 4GB memory and 256 SSD from the drawer.

Mobile I'm traveling with an [iPhone Xr](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP781?locale=de_DE) and an iPad 2019 generation.

### Software
The MacBook Air comes with macOS 14.1 under the hood and the T61 runs with [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com). The editor of my choice is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and for markdown I use [Typora](https://typora.io/). My data I move with [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) to the servers of [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) or a push with the [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) to [Github](https://github.com/). For graphics and photos, I use the grandiose [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) or [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/). Notes and ideas are still flowing into [UpNote](https://getupnote.com/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
